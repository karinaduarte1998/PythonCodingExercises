# Python Exercise 071:
# Create a program that simulates the operation of an ATM. At the beginning, ask the user what
# will be the amount to be withdrawn (integer number) and the program will inform how many bills of each value will
# be delivered.
# NOTE: consider that the cashier has R$50, R$20, R$10 and R$1 bills.
